⚙️ How It Works

The carousel elements are positioned relative to an anchor element using the CSS position: anchor method. This allows precise spatial control and enables the 3D rotation and depth effect without relying on JavaScript calculations.

Note: position: anchor is an experimental CSS feature and may not be supported in all browsers.
